# Stable Group Project Assignment Algorithm

An algorithm to assign students to projects based on their preferences.

A description of the problem and algorithm, pseudocode, example cases, time complexity analysis, evaluation, and discussion of the algorithm can be found in Report.pdf. The code in this repository implements the algorithm, generates test data, and evaluates and compares the algorithm to an algorithm which randomly assigns students to projects. 

This code and the report were created as part of a group project for CSE 374 Algorithms taught at Miami University. I wrote all of the code and almost all of the report by myself other than sections 2.3, and I wrote the pseudocode but didn't type it in LaTex. My group mates typed the pseudocode in LaTex, proofread the report, and created slides and a video presentation.
