# Stable Group Project Assignment Algorithm

An algorithm to assign students to projects based on their preferences.

A description of the problem and algorithm, pseudocode, example cases, time complexity analysis, evaluation, and discussion of the algorithm can be found in Report.pdf. The code in this repository implements the algorithm, generates test data, and evaluates and compares the algorithm to an algorithm which randomly assigns students to projects.
